# Werewolf Online

Want to play? Go to our [website](https://werewolf.selfhosted.website/)?

### What's Werewolf?

> One minute you're a Villager, defending your theoretical home with every fiber of your being. The next, you're a Werewolf, framing your friends and accusing them of wanting to destroy your village, when really it's you who's been infiltrating it all along. Each game becomes an epic phenomenon, designed to test your personal judgement and moral character.

### What's this?

As the game of Werewolf requires one player to serve as the moderator, we have decided to create an automatically moderated game. That way, everyone plays, and the moderator does not get confused when the number of roles and players rise.

This Kahoot-like game would wake the relevant roles up at night, calculate deaths, provide a fun voting system and announce the victorious players at the end. 

### Setup

All you have to do, open our website and start a new party. Connect to a bluetooth speaker (or something that would play the announcements loudly enough for the players to hear).

Select your roles (for beginners, we would stick with the classical setup, 1 healer, 1 fortune teller, werewolves and villagers)

Start the game.

Want to know more about how to play? See [Werewolf.co instructions](https://www.playwerewolf.co/rules/). Our game will play the moderator. All what's left for you to do is to enjoy the game.
