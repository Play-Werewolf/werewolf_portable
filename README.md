### What's Werewolf?

> One minute you're a Villager, defending your theoretical home with every fiber of your being. The next, you're a Werewolf, framing your friends and accusing them of wanting to destroy your village, when really it's you who's been infiltrating it all along. Each game becomes an epic phenomenon, designed to test your personal judgement and moral character. 
> - from [Werewolf.co](https://www.playwerewolf.co/), a distributor of the game
